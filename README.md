# Image-Steganography-using-Python
Using Python, we are going to hide a text inside another image, and also retrieve it.
This is useful for image encryption and secure transmission.
Spread Spectrum Steganography is the technique implemented here. It is a much advanced technique compared to LSB Steganography/ Spread Spectrum Steganography utilizes multiple levels of encryption with specific keys for decrypting them
